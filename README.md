# modelR
modelR is a framework built on top of R that could be used and extended by budding data scientists and students who are entering the data science fraternity to build models without much effort. 
The whole model building process is controlled by a single high level R file titled "main.R" that controls the Machine Learning Process.
modelR assumes the data resides in a Apache Hive repository and does the pull for data too.
